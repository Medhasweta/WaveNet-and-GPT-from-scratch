# Deep Learning Foundations: WaveNet & GPT Replication

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to replicating the seminal works of WaveNet and GPT as presented by Andrej Karpathy. These models represent significant milestones in the fields of audio synthesis and natural language processing, respectively. This project is an educational endeavor to deeply understand the mechanisms and principles underlying these complex architectures.

## Architecture
- **WaveNet**: A deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms, originally developed by DeepMind. It's known for its stack of dilated convolutional layers, enabling it to model audio data with long-range temporal dependencies.
- **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)**: A transformer-based model designed for a variety of natural language tasks. Its self-attention mechanism allows it to generate human-like text by understanding and predicting language patterns.

## Experiments
The process of replication follows the methodologies and instructions from the original codebases and publications. The aim is to mirror the experimental setup, data preprocessing, and training routines to achieve comparable outcomes to the original models.

## Results
The replication seeks to validate the performance of the models in synthesizing audio and text data. The expected results should align closely with the benchmarks provided by the original implementations, demonstrating the models' capabilities in their respective domains.

## Usage
To replicate these models:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the instructions in the training scripts to train the models.
4. Use the provided inference scripts to generate audio or text.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x  
PyTorch 1.x  
CUDA (for GPU acceleration)
